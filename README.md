# relib-template

Template of [`relib`](https://github.com/xxshady/relib).

Use `cargo run --features unloading` to compile host, module crates and run host binary.

**note:** you can also run it without `--features unloading` (see ["Usage without unloading"](https://docs.rs/relib/latest/relib/docs/index.html#usage-without-unloading)).
